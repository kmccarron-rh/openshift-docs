= Understanding PrivateLink

A Red Hat OpenShift service on an AWS cluster can be created without any public subnets or public internet access. In this configuration, Red Hat uses AWS PrivateLink to manage and monitor a cluster in order to ensure maximum security for all network traffic. For increased security, PrivateLink clusters are configured to have only internal API endpoints.
